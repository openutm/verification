# Fire Response

**Demonstration Goals:** UTM services allow a diverse set of users to appropriately coordinate their responses to an emergency.

## Details

- A new recreational flyer launches a VLOS flight for the first time in a park.
- The fire department is alerted to a possible fire and sends out a drone to quickly assess the scale of the fire. The recreational flyer is notified of the fire department drone and decides to begin landing.
- While landing, the recreational flyer briefly leaves the operation area triggering a notification to the fire department UTMSP but quickly returns to his area once notified and completes landing. Following the notification, the Fire Department uses RID to identify the recreational operator and following landing a member of the fire department can interact with the pilot advising him on other locations he might be able to fly in further from the fire.
- When the fire is verified, the fire department informs all operators nearby of the fire via dynamic restrictions. A news organisation comes to cover the fire and is informed of the fire area via the dynamic restriction. After seeing the dynamic restriction constraint, the news operator plans their operation around it to avoid a conflict.
- Seeing a nearby drone, the fire department is quickly able to determine that it belongs to a news organisation (with previously established processes with the fire department).
- In response to a Fire Department request an air ambulance is dispatched to site and the news operator in the area makes accommodations for the helicopter after being informed of its imminent arrival via a dynamic restriction.
